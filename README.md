# Spicetify-Launcher

A simple program that updates and applies Spicetify to Spotify.

## Apply on startup

Just press `Win + R` then type `shell:startup`
<br> <br>
then put the `Spicetify-Launcher.jar` in the folder.
<br> <br> <br>
That way Spicetify will always be updated and applied on startup.

## Install Spicetify

Check out the [Spicetify GitHub Repository](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli#) and follow the [Instructions](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started).

## Troubleshooting

Make sure that you have the [latest version of Java](https://www.oracle.com/de/java/technologies/downloads/) installed.
<br> <br>
Official support for Spicetify-Launcher is **only** available for **Windows**. <br>
It **could** work on Linux and Mac, but I can't guarantee that.
